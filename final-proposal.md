## Motivation for this project

-   Illicit drug use is a major public health issue in United States.
    Previous studies showed a relationship between illicit drug use and
    pop music
    \[[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30599351/),[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10826084.2012.637433)\],
    indicating that pop music may have a potential encouraging effect on
    illicit drug use \[[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18250243/)\].
    However, these studies are either cross-sectional, or need to be
    reproduce using more recent data.

## The intended final products

The intended final products will contain:

-   Descriptive information
    -   the trend of music genre
    -   the trend of the frequency of illicit drug in the popular music
    -   the trend of age of first-time illicit drug usage
    -   the trend of prevalence of different illicit drugs
-   Analysis
    -   the relationship between the trend of music genre and illicit
        drug description
    -   the relationship between the illicit drug description in music
        and the first-time illicit drug usage
    -   the relationship between the illicit drug description in music
        and the prevalences of illicit drug usage

## The anticipated data sources

The data sources are:

-   Popular music data: from [Data on Songs from Billboard
    1999-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019).
    The dataset contains the time of release, music genre, peak rank,
    and lyrics.

-   Illicit drug usage data: from [National Survey on Drug Use and
    Health (NSDUH)
    1999-2019](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2019-nsduh-2019-ds0001).
    The dataset is for state-level small area estimates (SAEs),
    associated confidence intervals, and other key statistics related to
    state-level, model-based estimates of certain key substance use and
    mental health outcomes.
